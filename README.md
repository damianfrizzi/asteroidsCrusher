# Frontend Boilerplate

A HTML5 boilerplate including RequireJS (along with the RequireJS-Text plugin), Backbone, Sass and jQuery.
Modernizr is used for feature detection and Bower for dependency management.

## Requirements
+ [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
+ [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
+ [Bower](http://bower.io/)

## Build
To minify and merge the JavaScript files you need to have [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

To start the build process simply run the following in the js directory:
```
node build
```
This starts the [RequireJS optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html).
