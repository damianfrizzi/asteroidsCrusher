# Asteroids Crusher
Asteroids Crusher is a HTML5 game based on the classic arcade game [Asteroids](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids). 

# Motivation
The game was produced during my time as a student at the SAE Institute Zurich. It was developed using the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework.

# State of the game
Although the game is working quite fine there are several bugs and misbehaviours that should be fixed. Unfortunately I haven't found the time to tackle those problems yet.

# Graphics
All graphics were created by [-wowu- from Graphicriver](https://graphicriver.net/item/game-assets-for-asteroids-crusher/9695040).
